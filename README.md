# Java Dependency Injection Demo

This project demonstrates the **dependency injection** principle in Java using a payment processing example. It highlights the use of interfaces to achieve loosely coupled and extensible code.

## Features
- Demonstrates dependency injection via constructor.
- Uses the **Strategy Design Pattern** to enable dynamic selection of payment methods.
- Easily extensible to add new payment methods.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/giriadarsh/DependencyInjection.git
